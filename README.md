# 👩‍💻 Hello!

I’m a **Business Analytics, Data Science** student on a journey to learn **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and everything in between! This GitHub is where I share my learning process, projects, and everything that makes me excited about coding.

Let’s break stuff, fix it, and build something amazing — one line of code at a time! 🚀

## 🌸 About This Space

Here on my GitHub, I:

- 💡 **Learn by doing**: I tackle real-world problems with code and data.
- 📊 Explore datasets to understand how businesses work (and maybe predict the future!).
- 🤖 Play around with **Machine Learning** — training computers to make decisions. It’s like teaching your computer to think!
- 🧠 Share **notebooks** and **code** with easy-to-follow explanations, so others can learn along with me.

## 🔬 Projects I’m Working On

- 📊 **Mini Data Challenges** — Playing with public datasets to uncover cool insights!
- 📈 **Sales Forecasting** — Predicting future sales based on past data (because who doesn’t love predictions?).
- 🤖 **Churn Prediction** — Using machine learning to figure out which customers might leave.
- 🧠 **Neural Networks** — Trying out some beginner-level deep learning (it’s like teaching computers to learn on their own!).

## 🚧 Ongoing Learning

Right now, I’m focusing on:

- **Python** and **R Programming** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning** — From simple linear regression to fun classification problems.
- **SQL** for handling data stored in databases (because data doesn’t live in spreadsheets alone!).
- **Data Visualization** — Making charts and graphs that tell awesome stories.
- **Cloud Tools** like **BigQuery** and **AWS** for working with big data.
